<h2>Internet Strategy</h2>

<p class="padt1">The Internet will continue to be embraced by organizations as a mainstream environment when providing information and services, and dealing with customers. <span class="hilite1">Developing an effective Internet strategy demands much more than building a website.</span> An internet strategy is long term planning executed to make a web site an integral part of a company's long term success. <span class="hilite2">It is an exciting opportunity to incorporate the Internet into the total business strategy.</span></p>

<p>Our internet strategy services focus on four core areas:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span class="blk1 strong">Visibility: </span>We use a combination of search engine optimization, pay-per-click advertising, affiliate marketing, and PR campaigns to help clients improve their visibility online.</li>
	<li><span class="blk1 strong">Impression: </span>On the Web, the experience is the brand. We help clients create a great impression by designing a visually appealing, functional, unique and easy-to-use web site.</li>
	<li><span class="blk1 strong">Conversion: </span>We help client develop strategies and ways to convert each user into a customer once they establish an impression and their curiosity is triggered.</li>
	<li><span class="blk1 strong">Retention: </span>We help clients create &quot;sticky&quot; features that motivate users to re-visit their web site again and again. These elements not only increase the conversion rate but also generate means of increased business from existing clients.</li>
