        <h1>Enterprise Application Integration</h1>
        <!--#include virtual="/solutions/right.php" -->
		<p>Most organizations' technology investments are a complicated tangle of systems, platforms and applications, many of which have overlapping functionality, and are designed with varying standards. Connecting these systems, platforms and applications takes more than dotted lines on paper. It takes an understanding of the business needs and right tools to accomplish those tasks.</p>
		<p>Our Enterprise Application Integration solutions focus on building a software infrastructure platform to simple connectivity between applications and clients to share information across application boundaries. We leverage investments in current systems and transform organizations by allowing applications to assume new roles in the business. Our integration team is fully conversant with all aspects of integration -- data level, user-interface level, application level and method level. We use proven approach and methodology to offer solutions that encompass the following areas:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Opening up ways for the information to flow from one application to another,</li>
			<li>Letting applications reach other sources of data outside themselves, and</li>
			<li>Allowing other programs to peer into the innards of formerly closed programs.</li>
			<li>Sharing data between divisions or even separate corporations</li>
		</ol>
