        <h1>Outsourcing</h1>
        <!--#include virtual="/solutions/right.php" -->
		<p>Today's public sector organizations are able to focus on the benefits of operational efficiency as well as the implementation of long-term strategies that lead to better delivery of public services. As a result, they are searching for new and innovative ways to deliver high quality, cost-effective solutions and services in order to boost performance.</p>
		<p>Outsourcing is a key strategic business tool that our public sector clients use to transform the ability to realize their strategic ambitions and Janatec is well placed to work in partnership with them to achieve this. With international strength, rare knowledge and experience of key industry sectors, technology and business processes, we deliver value in the form of cost-effectiveness, increased speed and agility. We help transform the way public sector organizations do business through contracts that offer superior services and solutions.</p>
		<p>Our outsourcing solutions focus on two key strategies:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Blended or Right Sourcing: </strong>Since there's no one size fits all approach to outsourcing, we offer a mix or blend of offerings that create the right balance between cost of delivery, risk management and quality of service. Our approach identifies the best combination of delivery sources for the services that our client is looking to outsource. Blended Sourcing provides each client with the best sourcing blend of in-house, onshore, nearshore and offshore engagement and delivery teams, to meet its specific requirements.</li>
			<li><strong>Progressive or Selective outsourcing: </strong>These days, outsourcing is no longer seen purely in terms of its abilities to deliver cost improvements. Leading organizations think of outsourcing more strategically and are looking to external service providers to help them with their own continuous improvement and growth. Our selective outsourcing model lets clients pick and choose whether to outsource discrete tasks or entire functional areas rather than transferring their entire information and communications technology operations and the total responsibility of managing it. This progressive or selective approach authenticates the benefits of outsourcing and enables our clients to retain control of overall strategy and access skills which would otherwise might be beyond reach in cost terms.</li>
