        <h1>E-Government</h1>
        <p>Information technology is a powerful enabler but the starting point should always be to identify what the customer wants and then look to how we use technology to achieve this. Our e-government services identify a common framework and direction for change across the public sector. It focuses on better services for citizens and businesses and more effective use of Government's information and communications technology resources.</p>
        <p>We believe that when people interact with the government they want to do so on their own terms. They want high quality services which are accessible, convenient and secure. We also believe that people should not need to understand how government is organized, or to know which department or agency does what, or whether a function is exercised by central or local government. We offer a strategy that provides this by helping departments and agencies, central and local government, cooperate in new partnerships that will offer their services in ways that make sense to the customer.</p>
		<p>Our e-government solutions focus on:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Citizen-focused government: </strong>Building services around citizens' choices.</li>
			<li><strong>Accessible services: </strong>Making government and its services more accessible over the internet, through mobile phones, digital TV, and personal computers.</li>
			<li><strong>Inclusiveness: </strong>Enhancing services or building new ones so that they are available to all citizens. This includes local citizens and others overseas as well as minority language groups and those with disability or limited mobility.</li>
			<li><strong>Information and change management: </strong>Using and managing information better, articulating a detailed change programme, and establishing new ways of doing business.</li>
		</ol>
