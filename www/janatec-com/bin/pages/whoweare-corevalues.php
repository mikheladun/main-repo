<ol class="values">
	<li><span class="blk1 strong">Team of Winners: </span>Understand our collective challenges and opportunities, choosing to work together for achievement of greater goals and aspirations. No barrier impedes us from providing our best efforts and our greatest value to complete a whole result of lasting importance.</li>
	<li><span class="blk1 strong">Customers for Life: </span>Consistently earn our customers' commitment by providing excellent value in exchange for their resources. Customers for life are those that cherish their business relationship with us because of the value and results that they receive from us. Our solutions and services are a component of our customer's own value proposition.</li>
	<li><span class="blk1 strong">Ideas to Action: </span>Balance a passion for starting anything that is possible with a requirement to finish everything that we start. Evolve constantly, requiring agility and judgment, never taking a risk for which we cannot be accountable. Always demonstrate the driving force and commitment to ask ourselves better questions, ultimately delivering better ideas.</li>
	<li><span class="blk1 strong">Respect and Honor: </span>Respect, act ethically and honorably, and be committed in all that we do for each other, our customers, and our communities. Respect and honor is an unbreakable contract that drives us to hold ourselves and each other at the highest esteem, both inside and outside of our company. Respect and honor produce integrity and dependability in all that we do.</li>
