        <h1>Shared Services</h1>
        <!--#include virtual="/solutions/right.php" -->
		<p>Shared Services will enable public sector organizations to be more effective and efficient in their day to day operations, thus releasing funds and resources to improve their service delivery to citizens and business. However, the transition to shared services poses significant transformational challenges to public sector organizations.</p>
		<p>Our flexible commercial approach to service provision leads to better delivery of public services.</p>
		<p>Our outsourcing solutions focus on two key strategies:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Identify: </strong>The first step is to identify business functions which have processes common to several organizations across the public sector</li>
			<li><strong>Analysis: </strong>Secondly, we conduct a detailed examination and analysis of existing business processes to enable them to be made common</li>
			<li><strong>Planning: </strong>Then, we develop a professionally managed programme to implement the changes to the processes</li>
			<li><strong>Selection: </strong>Finally, a decision can be made as to the most effective mechanism for providing the shared services - in house, outsourced or split</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The benefits of working in partnership with us for the provision of shared services include:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>access to professional management expertise and knowledge of the change mechanism required</li>
			<li>gain the time and information needed to provide strategic support to the business</li>
			<li>release resources to provide better services at the front line</li>
			<li>retain control from conception to delivery</li>
		</ol>
