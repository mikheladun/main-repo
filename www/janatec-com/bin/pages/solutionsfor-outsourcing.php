		<!--  Today's organizations are always searching for new and innovative ways to deliver high quality, cost-effective solutions and services in order to boost performance.  -->
		Outsourcing is a key strategic business tool that our clients use to <span class="hilite1">transform the ability to realize their strategic ambitions</span> and we are well placed to work in partnership with them to <span class="hilite2">deliver value in the form of cost-effectiveness, increased speed and agility.</span>
		<!--  We transform the way our clients do business through engagements that offer superior services and solutions. --></p>
	<p>Our outsourcing solutions focus on two key strategies:</p>

	<ol>
		<li><span class="blk1 strong">Blended sourcing: </span>Since there's no one size fits all approach to outsourcing, we offer a blend of offerings that create the right balance between cost of delivery, risk management and quality of service. Our approach identifies the best combination of delivery sources for the services that our client is looking to outsource. We provide each client with the best sourcing blend of in-house, onshore, nearshore and offshore engagement and delivery teams, to meet its specific requirements.</li>
		<li><span class="blk1 strong">Selective sourcing: </span>These days, outsourcing is no longer seen purely in terms of its abilities to deliver cost improvements. Our selective outsourcing model lets clients pick and choose whether to outsource discrete tasks or entire functional areas rather than transferring their operation and the total responsibility of managing it. This progressive approach enables our clients to retain control of overall strategy and access skills which would otherwise might be beyond reach in cost terms.</li>
